\section{Framing}
\begin{outline}
\1 You should frame CL specifically \emph{not} as "let's get you to orgasm" but rather as "let's discover what gets you maximum pleasure". An orgasm should not be framed as a goal but as a byproduct. It's the body's way of saying it has been saturated, like a burp after a big meal.
	\2 The question "Are you close?" is part of this bad framing. The questions "Higher? Lower? Faster? Slower?" are part of the good framing.
\1 Reassure her that her orgasm is NOT tied to your worth. This would be double pressure: not only is she pressured to reach the goal, but if she doesn't, she is insulting you!
	\2 Tell her that she should not be "nice about it". Her feedback should not be calculated from the anxiety of "he's going to be sad that he's not doing it well". Her feedback should solely reflect how much pleasure she feels. You can live with silence.
	\2 Evidence that worrying about a partner can block orgasm is that some women can't orgasm with a partner whilst being able to make themselves orgasm just fine. (Some women also can't do that.) That's why you need to frame it clearly.
\1 Reassure her that no part of her is inconveniencing you.
	\2 She may worry that you're getting tired. One woman said that you can't feel a massage once you start worrying about whether the other person's hands are getting tired and you should now ask them to stop out of politeness.
	\2 She may worry that she smells bad.
	\2 She may worry that she's not wet enough, or too wet.
	\2 She may worry that you think parts of her are too fat.

\1 Testimonials:
	\2 One woman says that when she's too self-conscious about coming, she closes her eyes and pictures the scene as a 3rd person. She pictures her vulva, the wetness, the tongue/finger entering her, etc.
	\2 One woman says she sets a timer for 20 minutes where she does not speak, puts on an eye-mask, and just lays back. Whatever happens, happens. Whatever doesn't doesn't. Mind empty.
	\2 One woman says she likes to imagine her partner actually getting off on her enjoyment while he's performing CL on her. (He can't show it himself of course, because he's busy.)
\end{outline}

\section{Signalling}
\begin{outline}
\1 Allegedly, the biggest reason women don’t give their partner feedback is being afraid to hurt their feelings.

\1 Some ways to give directions:
	\2 Exercise for her: masturbate (using just fingers) with the intent of exploring all possible ways that can give pleasure, to actually know what to tell a partner.
		\3 One woman had to use a mirror to know how to describe it.
		\3 One woman sits in her man's lap, back facing him, and uses his hands to teach his muscle-memory what feels good on her.

		\3 What feels good depends on the stage of coreplay she is in.

	\2 One way to avoid criticism is to use Newspeak: bad things are just "good", good things get a much larger reaction.
	\2 Put made-up labels on things you like, so that you don't fall into the "that one thing you did" trap.


\1 Some ways to ask for directions:
	\2 Demonstrated binary questions work well: "Higher like this [demonstrate] or lower like this [demonstrate]?", softer/harder, faster/slower, ...
	\2 

\1 Testimonials:
	\2 One woman says she doesn't like her nor her man using words to indicate what feels good.
	\3 She herself gives squeezes or moans to positively reinforce. However, some women may go silent when something feels good!
	\3 She wants her man to keep it sexy, not mechanical. Don't say "hey, please change the angle", say "come close to me, I want to feel your body against me".
	\2 One woman says she is direct in the bedroom: she will just guide a man's hand, and say things like "do that again", "don't stop", ...
	\2 One woman says she demonstrates what she wants outside of the bedroom, using her hand knuckles as a model of the clitoral head.
	\2 One woman says that when she wants point $X$ on the man to touch/rub point $Y$ on her, she will move to make $Y$ more easily accessible to $X$, or will just put $Y$ on $X$, and maintain the pressure she would like.
	\2 One woman simulates what she likes on herself when she is already naked and he is still undressing.
	\2 One woman uses the pitch of her moans as good-bad scale (deep moan is good, high moan is "try something else"), like Newspeak but without words.
	\2 One woman caresses the man's thigh when it's good and taps when it's bad.

\section{Consistency}
\begin{outline}
\1 For 2 in 3 women, whatever motion is happening when she feels the orgasm "bubble up" (which probably feels the same as with men), needs to be locked in \emph{exactly the same} until the orgasm. That means:
	\2 Do not pause. Not even for 1 second. Edging breaks the buildup.
	\2 Do not reposition yourself unless it is to keep contact.
	\2 Keep contact with the same location, even if she is moving.
	\2 Keep the same path.
	\2 Keep the same direction. Even switching from clockwise to counterclockwise breaks the buildup.
	\2 Keep the same pattern. (E.g.: "3 small circles on the hood, 1 large circle brushing the clit".)
	\2 Keep the same pace. Not faster, not slower.
	\2 Keep the same pressure. Not harder, not softer. 
	\2 If it's penetration: same angle.

\1 Even during orgasm, it's safe to hold the same motion for another 20 seconds.

\1 Remember the golden rule of SCF: \emph{do not meet passion with passion}.

\1 The reason vibrators work so well is that they are \emph{really} consistent.
	\2 Also, note that the path vibrators trace is really short. It's not distance, it's consistency.

\1 Signalling for this is mostly just "that's it, keep going, don't stop".

\1 Demo video (ngl she has fantastic boobs and a nice vulva):
	\2 To wake up the vulva, close the outer labia, and drag them in circles.
	\2 Then, to open up the lips, stroke in the middle between them from bottom to top.
	\2 Once she is wet at the bottom of the vestibule, brush the lubrication upwards using a finger-walking motion.
	\2 When everything is awake, this particular woman puts a finger on her front commissure and moves it side-to-side.
\end{outline}


\section{Rhythm}
\begin{outline}
\1 \emph{Rhythm}: repeating pattern of (the hits of) whatever motion you're doing.
	\2 \emph{Raindrops}: random delays between hits.
	\2 \emph{Skipping}: constant, big delay between hits. Can be because you skip half of your motion (e.g.\ only do left strokes, not right strokes).
	\2 \emph{Back-to-back}: no delay between hits. No room to breathe.
	\2 \emph{Pulsating}: hits overlap. Overstimulation, like a vibrator.

\1 During penetration, rhythm should not come from long in-out strokes, but rather from staying inside and vibrating your pubic bone on her (I guess in the least spastic way you can manage). This is called \emph{rocking}.

\1 \emph{Tapping} is apparently not so uncommon as a preferred motion over stroking.

\1 For women with a really sensitive clitoris, do not touch the head directly and do not use repetitive stimulation. Rather, use firm pressure below or around the head, and play with the vulva more.

\1 Demo video 1:
	\2 She likes a kind of morse code tapping on her clitoral hood: start with 20 seconds of fast taps. Then 20 seconds of slow taps as a kind of edging (the clitoris wants faster stimulation, but you're teasing it by withholding). Then after that a mix of both. She literally does this from start to orgasm.
	\2 Instead of tapping, \emph{bobbing} also works, where the highest point of the motion is skin level, and then you press the hood inwards.
	
\1 Demo video 2:
	\2 To wake up the vulva, she gives light taps all over it, like an ant feeling with an antenna.
	\2 She then alternates between putting firmer taps on the inside of her labia minora, and firmly swiping the labia minora outwards. 
	\2 Finally, to orgasm, she wags her finger somewhere at the bottom of the vulva (either fourchette or introitus, I can't tell), nowhere near the clit and not fingering inside. I believe this is called \emph{shallowing}.
